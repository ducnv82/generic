This project is a skeleton for a Java web application. It is like appfuse http://www.appfuse.org/ but it is more lightweight.
And it does not use interface unnecessarily, because, we often define interfaces but there is only 1 implementation, so, skip defining interfaces.


1. Package structures
-generic.domain: JPA entities
-generic.dao: DAO classes
-generic service: Service classes
-generic.web: web layer related classes
-generic.web.bean: JSF bean
